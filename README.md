PlayCanvasExperiments
=====================

Just some small experiments with the PlayCanvas graphics engine 

###Ex 1: Spinning Cube
*Codepen: http://codepen.io/Nigh7Sh4de/pen/vEYzeP*

Fairly standard first thing to do in a 3D gaming change, it's a cube and it will rotate FOREVER

###Ex 2: Moving Cube
*Codepen: http://codepen.io/Nigh7Sh4de/pen/PwodOY*

Added some keyboard functionality, now you can move the cube around your screen :D

###Ex 3: Travelling Cube
*Codepen: http://codepen.io/Nigh7Sh4de/pen/MYWqvm/*

Added a textured floor for our cube (which I have now named Paul [in loving memory of the naggy lama from the YouTube mini-series, Lamas With Hats]) and the WASD keys will now move the cube in the X-Z plane (basically it can't jump up and down).
